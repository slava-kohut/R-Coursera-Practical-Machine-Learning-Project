# Machine Learning for Human Activity Recognition: Weight Lifting Exercises
---
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 
The goal of the project was to develop a model for predicting quality of execution of weight lifting exercises starting from accelerometer data.
